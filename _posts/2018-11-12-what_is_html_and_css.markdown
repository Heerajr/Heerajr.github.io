I think the most important thing to know about HTML and CSS is what is is. HTML and CSS are the foundations of the web. HTML-“HyperText Markup Language” is the language used to tell the browser what each part of the website is. HTML defines paragraphs, headers links, images and much more. Your browser then uses this information to create a webpage.CSS-“Cascading Style Sheets” is the language that makes webpages look the way they do and puts it in that format. CSS is the fonts, coloring and backgrounds that make the pages look appealing. I think this is a important foundation for using HTML and CSS.
