Before I started my classes I tinkered with the idea and did some self studying. I found some of the Concepts VERY hard while others were difficult but i managed around it.  Most of the people I spoke to said it was easy to grasp the idea and use it as needed and many things were on google. Through the more structured process I learnt that this is NOT the case.  The concepts were co-dependent on each other. One thing leads to another. Yes most ideas are on google however they are not used on the same pretense, or they talk about it in a completly different way. Sometimes i got more confused from trying to go elsewhere then if i were to re read the sections. Dont get me wrong, Some times they were helpful and I did understand the concpet more but more times than not I got more confused. Personally I have learnt to go back and reread the lessons and watch the videos, sometimes over 5 times. The answers were clearly there I just didnt get it. But with the help of "Ask a question" I was always able to find out my answers and get help. I will admit there are some things  that I still didnt understand but I got the answer to,however I still try to understand things before moving forward. Althought Coding as a whole is more difficult than I thought I think it will be a  journey well worth it!
