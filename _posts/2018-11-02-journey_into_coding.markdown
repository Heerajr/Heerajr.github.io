My "# Journey Into Coding" started a little late for me but it has always been laced in my mind.From the begin of my teenage years I have always been interested in just about anything that has circuits and is computerized.  I have never thought of it as a career option just more of a hobby or something I enjoy. Recently I have further explored my options in technology. Currently I am in the automotive field but have always been interested in the tech behind it.  Recently I have been convinced by my wife to looking into a career in software engineering. I first started looking at self taught options but found it difficult to follow and not structured. I researched options at a professional level and found flat iron to be the best fit for me, so far my experiance has been great and exactly what I was looking for, Eveything is structured in a way I can understand and there are many avenues for help available if I need them. But that is How I started my Journey into coding.
